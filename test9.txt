Title: Repeated Series of Requests Separated by a few second time slice

Author: Stephen Sampson B00568374

Purpose: The purpose of this test is to see how the web server will react when the client
sends a series of HTTP requests in a random order where some of the requests are for the same file,
delays for a few seconds, and then sends another series of requests. This tests that the server
sleeps and wakes properly and that a previously processed queue has no impact on a new queue.


Expected Result: The web server should add all valid requests to the queue. Jobs will be sorted 
by size but where any jobs have the same size, they will be sorted by their sequence number.
Therefore files will be processed SJF where requests of identical filesize will be handled in
a FCFS manner.


The printed sequence on the server side will vary based on CPU scheduling.


On the client side, eight HTTP responses will be sent 'HTTP/1.1 200 OK' followed by the files
that were requested. It will then display nothing for a few seconds until the next batch of
requests comes through at which point it will display another eight HTTP responses followed
by the files that were requested
