Title: Some Files not Found

Author: Stephen Sampson B00568374

Purpose: The purpose of this test is to see how the web server will react when the client
sends a a series of HTTP requests where some of the requests are for a filename that does 
not match any files in the working directory. This will test the sequence counting and error
handling of the multithreaded web server. 

Expected Result: The web server should add all valid requests to the queue. The request for
the file not found will not be assigned a sequence order or added to the queue, therefore 
requests 1,2,4,5,6,8,9, and 10 will be processed but requests 3 and 7 will not. The suspected 
order of completion is shown below however actual order will vary depending on CPU scheduling.

Request 1 Completed
Request 2 Completed
Request 3 Completed
Request 4 Completed
Request 5 Completed
Request 6 Completed
Request 7 Completed
Request 8 Completed

On the client side, ten HTTP responses will be sent, two being 'HTTP/1.1 404 File Not Found'
