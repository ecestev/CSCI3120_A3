The purpose of this assignment is to get you to use threads (pthreads) and to implement some
synchronization mechanisms on top of your scheduling server. In this assignment you build upon
Assignment 2, to create a Multithreaded Scheduling Web Server. You will:
1. Implement multithreading in your assignment 2 solution (or the one provided), and
2. Create a test suite for the multithreaded scheduling web server.
You have a choice: You can either use your code from Assignment 2 as the starting point, or you can
use the provided solution to Assignment 2. Regardless, you need to ensure that you have assn3
checked out in your SVN repository. This directory will contain the solution to Assignment 2.
Please follow the guidelines in Section 5.1.
