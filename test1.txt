Title: Requests for Identical File

Author: Stephen Sampson B00568374

Purpose: The purpose of this test is to see how the web server will react when the client
sends a a series of HTTP requests all for the same file.

Expected Result: The web server should add all valid requests to the queue. Then, during the 
sort algorithm for any jobs that the size is equal, they will be sorted by sequence number and
therefore processed in a FCFS basis.

The requests will therefore be processed in order of sequence number.

Request 1 Completed
Request 2 Completed
Request 3 Completed
Request 4 Completed
Request 5 Completed
Request 6 Completed
Request 7 Completed
Request 8 Completed
Request 9 Completed
Request 10 Completed

On the client side, ten HTTP responses will be sent 'HTTP/1.1 200 OK' followed by the file
that was requested.
