Title: Improper HTTP Protocol

Author: Stephen Sampson B00568374

Purpose: The purpose of this test is to see how the web server will react when the client
sends a malformed HTTP request where the method and location are acurate but the protocol is not.

Expected Result: The web server should sent error message 400 to the client but not schedule the request
or increment the sequence counter.

This will be tested by running test 8.in immediately after this test and verifying that it is assigned
sequence number 1.
